# Custom scripts

A collection of custom Rust scripts for personal usage.

Run `./install.sh` to install all. This deploys:

- Rust scripts to `$CARGO_HOME/bin/`
- Shell scripts to `~/.bin/`

## Git Hooks

There're two hooks, which automatically deploy the project when pulling new commits.

Great for syncing changes between multiple machines.
